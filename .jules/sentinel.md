## 2024-05-24 - Fix Console Warnings Exposure
**Vulnerability:** Error messages were being logged using `console.warn` across various utility and component files (e.g. `AdBanner.tsx`, `useInterstitialAd.ts`, `notificationAnalytics.ts`, `backgroundTasks.ts`). In production, this can leak sensitive stack trace details or API error specifics.
**Learning:** React Native logging mechanisms like `console.warn` are visible in device logs (like logcat or Console.app) in production if not stripped or sanitized, which can inadvertently leak application structure or environment data.
**Prevention:** Always use the centralized `logger` utility (e.g., `logger.warn` or `logger.error`), which handles environment-specific logging (i.e. sanitization in production).
## 2025-02-21 - [DoS Risk Mitigation in TextInput]
**Vulnerability:** The primary `TextInput` component used for affirmations lacked an explicit length limit (`maxLength`).
**Learning:** This exposes the application to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) vector where users could paste excessively large strings (megabytes of text), causing the React Native validation loop, text comparison logic (`getValidationInfo`, `getHighlightSegments`), and rendering to consume excessive CPU and memory, potentially freezing or crashing the device.
**Prevention:** Always enforce reasonable bounds on user input using the `maxLength` prop on all `TextInput` components, particularly those triggering complex operations on every keystroke.
