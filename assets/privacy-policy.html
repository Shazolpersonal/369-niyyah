    <h1>🕌 Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="date">Last updated: February 22, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>369 Niyyah</strong> ("the App") is a daily Islamic affirmation app built to help users strengthen their
        connection with Allah through the 369 writing method. Your privacy is extremely important to us.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>369 Niyyah does <strong>not collect, store, or transmit any personal data</strong> to our own servers. Most of
        the app operates entirely offline.</p>
    <p>However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. This information is
        collected directly by these third parties and is not stored or accessed by us.</p>

    <h2>2. Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The app stores the following data locally on your device using AsyncStorage:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your daily affirmation progress</li>
        <li>Your start date and streak count</li>
        <li>Your language preference (English or Bengali)</li>
        <li>Onboarding completion status</li>
        <li>Ad display frequency (to limit interruptions)</li>
        <li>Notification interaction times (to personalize delivery schedules)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data stays on your device and is not accessible by us.</p>

    <h2>3. Notifications</h2>
    <p>The app may request permission to send local push notifications to remind you of your daily affirmation sessions.
        These are scheduled locally on your device and are not powered by any external cloud service.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use <strong>Google AdMob</strong> to display advertisements within the App. This service helps us keep the App
        free to use. To provide relevant ads and prevent fraud, Google may collect certain information, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>IP Address</li>
        <li>Device identifiers (e.g., Android Advertising ID)</li>
        <li>App usage and interaction data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more information on how Google uses your data, please visit:<br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Privacy & Terms</a><br>
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Google uses
            information from sites or apps that use our services</a>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 12px;"><strong>Opting Out of Personalized Ads:</strong><br>
        You can opt-out of personalized advertising by visiting your Google account's Ad Settings or by
        resetting/deleting your device's advertising identifier through your device settings (e.g., on Android: Settings
        > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Ads).</p>

    <h2>5. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>Because 369 Niyyah does not store any personal data on its own servers, there is no account or personal data for
        us to delete. You can delete all locally stored data at any time by clearing the App's storage/cache in your
        device settings or by uninstalling the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App and its advertising are directed to users who are 13 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect
        personal information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your
        child has provided us with data, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected with an updated "Last updated"
        date at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
